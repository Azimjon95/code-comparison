# Code Comparison: Java Odd/Even Check

This repository compares two different ways of handling the check for odd/even numbers in Java, specifically through two code snippets that check the value of a number `N` and print different results based on whether the number is odd or even. Both snippets achieve the same goal, but they approach it in slightly different ways. This README provides a detailed explanation of the differences in their implementation and logic.

## Purpose
The goal of this code is to check whether a number `N` is odd or even and print specific messages based on the numberâ€™s value. If the number is odd, it will print `"Weird"`. If the number is even, it will print `"Not Weird"` for certain ranges and `"Weird"` for others.

## Approach 1: **Explicit Range Handling**

```java
public class FirstSnippet {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int N = 4; // Change this value for testing
        if (N % 2 == 1) { // Odd numbers
            System.out.println("Weird");
        } else { // Even numbers
            if (N >= 2 && N <= 5) {
                System.out.println("Not Weird");
            } else if (N >= 6 && N <= 20) {
                System.out.println("Weird");
            } else { // N > 20 and even
                System.out.println("Not Weird");
            }
        }
    }
}

Odd numbers: The code first checks if N is odd by using N % 2 == 1. If true, it prints "Weird".
Even numbers: If N is even, it checks specific ranges:
If N is between 2 and 5, it prints "Not Weird".
If N is between 6 and 20, it prints "Weird".
If N is greater than 20, it prints "Not Weird".
This approach gives a very clear and explicit distinction between different ranges for even numbers.
Advantages:
More detailed handling of specific even number ranges.
Easy to understand and maintain when exact behavior is needed for different ranges.
Disadvantages:
Slightly more verbose due to explicit range checks for even numbers.

## Approach 1: **Concise Range Handling**

public class SecondSnippet {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int N = 4; // Change this value for testing
        if (N % 2 == 1) {
            System.out.println("Weird");
        } else if (N <= 5) {
            System.out.println("Not Weird");
        } else if (N <= 20) {
            System.out.println("Weird");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Not Weird");
        }
    }
}

Odd numbers: The logic for checking odd numbers is the same: N % 2 == 1. If N is odd, it prints "Weird".
Even numbers: For even numbers, this snippet uses simpler conditions:
If N is less than or equal to 5, it prints "Not Weird".
If N is between 6 and 20, it prints "Weird".
If N is greater than 20, it prints "Not Weird".
This approach is more compact but handles the ranges in a less explicit manner.
Advantages:
More concise and shorter code.
Easier to write quickly, especially for simple cases.
Disadvantages:
Less explicit in terms of range boundaries, which can be less clear when dealing with edge cases or when maintaining larger codebases.
